**Highly Important Concept** as you will be using later in **Graphs and Dynamic Programming**. <br> 
*So, don’t take this for granted doesn’t matter how simple it sounds.*

## Quick Recap
1. 2D Arrays can be thought of table, but think in terms **matrices**.
2. Syntax for 2D Array Declaration.
```{datatype} {arrayName}[rows][columns];```
3. Take a look on indices and bla bla ... <br>
