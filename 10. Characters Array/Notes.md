# Character Array

## Quick Recap
1. Array of Characters is called Character Array.
2. Syntax for Declaration ```char {arrayName}[size+1];```
3. Note: "size+1" is to ensure **null character** at the end.

## Why Null Character by the way ?
The last character or "size+1" th character of our character array is null character.<br>
It indicates end of character arrray. <br>

# Things to Learn from Programs

## 1. Check Null
1. **String Input** is always in between **“...”**
2. **Any Character** is always in between **‘...’**
3. **Null Character** is represented by **‘\0’**
4. **ERROR** Maybe in condition of Loop
5. **IMPORTANT**  Whenever we create a character array null is automatically added to the end.

## 2. Input And Output
1.  On Inputs like "Microsoft GitHub", only Microsoft will be considered.

## 3. Palindrome Check
1. Cool Examples of Palindrome
"Racecar", "Nitin", "Level", "Madam", "Mom", "Noon".
2. Initialize flag = True
3. You need one condition where characters are not equal then set flag = true and break
4. Last word check can be performed n-1-i
5. In Highly Optimized Apporach, you just need to traverse n/2 times irrespetive of even or odd cases.

## 4. Largest Word In Sentence

## Doubts
1. Why don't we enter null character while giving input ? <br>
It automatically adds
2. How to take string input with spaces like "Microsoft GitHub" ?
3. In Palindrome Question, what if word's input size < char array size ? How to determine the size ?
4. With only racecar as input, how to understand the outputs.
